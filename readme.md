This repo is served as personal reference for myself thoughout the whole journey of learning SpringBoot.  
  
 - Structure  
 	 - All the materials have referenced are listed on the front page (This readme). Along with a table of content (TBC) to have a rough explaination of the example it.  

 	 - As I am trying to make the whole thing be organised, all example would be placed on the top lv with the dir that named along with the materials name.
 	 Let say a sample project call ```social media demo``` which inspired by the book ```PlzLearnJava```. Then the project would be placfed with path ```./PlzLearnJava/social_media_demo```

 - Remark
 	 - As this repo allow public access, I would try my best to upload matertials that only written by me, however sometimes code may exist that is either from text-book example || Online forum code segment. In this way I will try 
 	 my best to rewrite it in my own way, however during the transaction period. Code with other's author may exist, it only exist when the certain license permit to do so. In this case all license info along with the author name would placed on the header for every Src. 

 - Book list:
 	 - Learning Spring Boot 2.0 - Second Edition [Greg L. Turnquist]  - [Git](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-Spring-Boot-2.0-Second-Edition)
 	 	- Things to be done:
 	 		 - Tranform book example into a proper Spring App (Config server eureka, microservies)
